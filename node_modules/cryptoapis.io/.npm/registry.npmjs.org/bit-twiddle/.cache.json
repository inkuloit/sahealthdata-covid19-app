is a collection of miscellaneous bit twiddling hacks ported to JavaScript, mostly taken from here:\n\n* [Stanford Bit Twiddling Hacks](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html)\n\n[![testling badge](https://ci.testling.com/mikolalysenko/bit-twiddle.png)](https://ci.testling.com/mikolalysenko/bit-twiddle)\n\n[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mikolalysenko/bit-twiddle.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mikolalysenko/bit-twiddle)\n\nInstall\n=======\nVia npm:\n\n    npm install bit-twiddle\n\n# API\n\n### `sign(v)`\nComputes the sign of the integer v.  Returns:\n* -1 if v < 0\n*  0 if v === 0\n* +1 if v > 0\n\n### `abs(v)`\nReturns the absolute value of the integer v\n\n### `min(x,y)`\nComputes the minimum of integers x and y\n\n### `max(x,y)`\nComputes the maximum of integers x and y\n\n### `isPow2(v)`\nReturns `true` if v is a power of 2, otherwise false.\n\n### `log2(v)`\nReturns an integer approximation of the log-base 2 of v\n\n### `log10(v)`\nReturns log base 10 of v.\n\n### `popCount(v)`\nCounts the number of bits set in v\n\n###  `countTrailingZeros(v)`\nCounts the number of trailing zeros.\n\n### `nextPow2(v)`\nRounds v up to the next power of 2.\n\n### `prevPow2(v)`\nRounds v down to the previous power of 2.\n\n### `parity(v)`\nComputes the parity of the bits in v.\n\n### `reverse(v)`\nReverses the bits of v.\n\n### `interleave2(x,y)`\nInterleaves a pair of 16 bit integers.  Useful for fast quadtree style indexing.  (See wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve )\n\n### `deinterleave2(v, n)`\nDeinterleaves the bits of v, returns the nth part.  If both x and y are 16 bit, then it is true that:\n\n```javascript\ndeinterleave2(interleave2(x,y), 0) === x\ndeinterleave2(interleave2(x,y), 1) === y\n```\n    \n### `interleave3(x,y,z)`\nInterleaves a triple of 10 bit integers.  Useful for fast octree indexing.\n\n### `deinterleave3(v, n)`\nSame deal as `deinterleave2`, only for triples instead of pairs\n\n### `nextCombination(x)`\nReturns next combination ordered colexicographically.\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\nCode is ported from Sean Eron Anderson's public domain bit twiddling hacks page.  http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html\nJavaScript implementation (c) 2013 Mikola Lysenko.
